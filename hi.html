        HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you so much mom and this took me forever to code. I wish I could have given this to you earlier and had scheduled a lab with my teacher to help me with this but was sent home. I wanted it to be really lavish and stuff. Either way, I really put my best effort into making this using what I learned in computer science class and hopy you love it.
